Strategy

My primary objective in completing this task was to create a new API route and controller function for retrieving products by section, as instructed. Below, I outline the key steps I took to accomplish this task:

Fork the Repository: To work on the task, I began by forking the provided GitHub repository. This allowed me to have my own copy of the project, separate from the original.

Clone: After forking, I cloned the repository to my local development environment using the git clone command. This step enabled me to work on the code locally.

Implement the Task: Following the task's requirements, I proceeded to create a new API route, /api/products/{section}, and added a controller function for this route. The controller function retrieves products based on the specified section.

Test the API: To ensure that the newly added functionality worked correctly, I conducted testing using cURL commands and a web browser. This step allowed me to confirm that products were indeed being retrieved based on the provided section.

Create NOTES.md: I've created this NOTES.md file to document my strategy and any enhancements I introduced while completing the task. These notes provide insight into my thought process and improvements made.

Improvements
In the course of completing this task, I aimed to enhance the codebase in several ways:

Optimized Database Queries: I optimized the database queries within the controller function to minimize resource consumption and improve response times. Efficient queries are crucial for maintaining application performance.

Error Handling: Robust error handling was incorporated into the controller function. This ensures that potential exceptions are gracefully managed, and meaningful error responses are returned to clients when necessary.

Input Validation: To bolster security, I implemented input validation for the section parameter. This helps sanitize user input, mitigating the risk of security vulnerabilities like SQL injection.
