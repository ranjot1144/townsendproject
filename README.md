# Townsend Music Laravel Coding Test

## Objective

Your task is to refactor the `GetProductsController` without altering its existing functionality fixing any bugs that you may find.

## Existing API Route

We have an existing API route, `/api/products`, which returns all products. This functionality should remain unchanged.

## New API Route

Please create a new API route `/api/products/{section}`, which will return all products belonging to a specified section.

## Models and Relationships

The models and their relationships have already been established; there's no need for additional configuration in this area.

## Development Environment

You are free to use any methodologies or packages as deemed fit for this task. Set up your dev environment using the setup that you are most comfortable with. The project already includes [Laravel Sail](https://github.com/laravel/sail) for your convenience.

## Test Data

Test data is provided through seeders. After running the `php artisan migrate --seed` command, your database should be ready for use.
